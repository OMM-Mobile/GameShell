💻 Technical Requirements
Before installing GameShell, ensure your system meets the following specifications for the best experience:

Operating System: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).

Controller Support: Xbox 360/One/Series, DualShock 4, DualSense, and most X-Input compatible handheld controllers (e.g., Hall Effect triggers).

Software Dependencies: .NET Framework 4.8 or higher / DirectX 11 or 12.

Storage: Minimal (approx. 200MB for the app), plus additional space for cached game artwork.

Internet: Required for initial setup and metadata/cover art scraping.

🚀 Quick-Start Setup Guide
Follow these five steps to transform your PC into a gaming powerhouse.

1. Installation & Initial Launch
Download the GameShell installer and follow the on-screen prompts. Upon first launch, the Setup Wizard will guide you through basic permissions to allow GameShell to display over other windows.

2. Connect Your Library
GameShell will ask to scan your system. You can:

Auto-Sync: Select platforms like Steam or Epic Games to automatically import your installed titles.

Manual Add: Select your .exe and shortcuts or folder paths for DRM-free games or emulators.

3. Fetch Artwork
Once your games are listed, click "Refresh Metadata." GameShell will match your titles against our database to download high-definition cover art and background visuals.

4. Configure Controller & UI
Navigate to Settings > Input to calibrate your controller. You can also visit Settings > Theme to adjust the UI scaling—we recommend 150% or higher if you are playing on a TV or a 7-inch handheld screen.

5. Set as Default (Optional)
For the true console experience, toggle "Launch on System Startup" in the General Settings. This ensures GameShell loads immediately when you turn on your device, bypassing the Windows desktop entirely.

💡 Pro-Tips for the Best Experience
The "Ghost Mode" Setting: Enable Minimize on Game Launch to ensure GameShell consumes zero CPU/GPU resources while you are in-game.

Global Hotkeys: Map a "Home" button (like the Xbox or PS button) to bring GameShell to the front at any time, even if a game is currently running.
